# USB Mouse Firmware

We built this project as part of [14-642: Introduction to Embedded Systems](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece349/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

The files published in this repository were part of a larger project of building a fully functional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). I'm not publishing the other source code of that project to abide by the course policies.

The board used for this project is [nRF52840](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/struct_nrf52/struct/nrf52840.html).

## Documentation

Check out our documentation: [here](/usb-mouse-firmware.pdf).

This project was built by [Nandan Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandandesai/) and [Tariq Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tariqahmed2000/).

## Note

We completed this project within 1-2 weeks during the final stages of the Fall 2023 semester. We implemented the USB stack only to the extent of getting it to work and didn't use any external libraries. This project helps you if you want to know how the USB protocol works (again, check out our [documentation](/usb-mouse-firmware.pdf)). But its certainly not suitable if you want to build a reliable USB mouse.
